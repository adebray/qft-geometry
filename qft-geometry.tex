\section{Introductory motivation}

\subsection{Linear equations}
Suppose we are interested in studying
the topology of smooth manifolds $X$.
One powerful tool for this purpose is to
introduce an ingredient which at first seems alien to the
problem: namely we fix a Riemannian metric $g$ on $X$.
This allows us to define the \ti{form Laplacian} \eqref{eq:form-laplacian}
and consider the space of \ti{harmonic forms}
\begin{equation}
  \cH^k(X) = \{ \omega \in \Omega^k(X) \vert \Delta \omega = 0 \}.
\end{equation}

The equation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:laplace}
\Delta \omega = 0
\end{equation}
is a \ti{linear} equation over $\R$.
Thus $\cH^k(X)$ is a \ti{vector space}.
If $X$ is compact, then $\cH^k(X)$ is moreover finite-dimensional (a consequence of
the fact that $\Delta$ is an \ti{elliptic} operator). Thus we can define
positive integers by
\begin{equation}
  b_k(X) = \dim_\R \cH^k(X).
\end{equation}
There is a remarkable fact about these integers:
\begin{fact} \label{fact:betti-numbers-are-topological} The integers $b_k$ do not depend on the choice of Riemannian metric or smooth
structure on $X$; instead they are invariants of the underlying topological manifold
(the \ti{Betti numbers}).
\end{fact}

\begin{exercise} Work out explicitly the spaces $\cH^k(X)$ and
Betti numbers $b_k(X)$ for some of the following: $X = S^1, T^2, S^2$.
(In each case choose a convenient Riemannian metric; of course the $b_k$
are independent of which metric you choose, though the $\cH^k(X)$
naively are not.)
\end{exercise}

\autoref{fact:betti-numbers-are-topological}
is a consequence of a stronger, ``categorified'' statement:
\begin{fact} There is a canonical isomorphism
\begin{equation}
  \cH^k(X) \simeq H^k(X,\R)
\end{equation}
(where $H^k$ means singular cohomology).
\end{fact}

If $X$ is an oriented Riemannian $4n$-manifold then there is a small refinement of the
middle Betti number $b_{2n}$:
we have the ``Hodge star'' operator
\begin{equation}
  \star: \Omega^{2n}(X) \to \Omega^{2n}(X)
\end{equation}
which has the crucial properties
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\star^2 = 1$,
  \item $[\star, \Delta] = 0$.
\end{itemize}
The first property says we can decompose into the $\pm 1$-eigenspaces
for $\star$:\footnote{concretely $\omega = \half(1 + \star) \omega + \half(1 - \star) \omega $}
\begin{equation}
  \Omega^n(X) = \Omega^{n,+}(X) \oplus \Omega^{n,-}(X).
\end{equation}
Combining this with the second property one sees that the harmonic forms also decompose:
\begin{equation}
  \cH_{2n}(X) = \cH_{2n}^+(X) \oplus \cH_{2n}^-(X), \qquad b_{2n}(X) = b_{2n}^+(X) + b_{2n}^-(X).
\end{equation}

\begin{exercise} Suppose instead that $X$ is an oriented  $(4n+2)$-manifold. Here the story is a bit different, because in dimension $k = 2n+1$
we have $\star^2 = -1$.
Show that in this case the Betti number $b_{2n+1}(X)$ is even.
(Is this still true if $X$ is not orientable?)
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Nonlinear equations}

Now we will replace the linear equation
\eqref{eq:laplace} by a \ti{nonlinear} equation.

Unlike linear equations --- which in some sense behave uniformly
in the dimension --- nonlinear equations tend to behave very
differently in different dimensions. With this in mind
we now specialize to the case $\dim X = 4$.
In this case, a new source of topological
(or more precisely smooth) invariants was discovered
by Donaldson in the 1980s. For an excellent reference see \cite{MR1079726}.

Fix a compact Lie group $G$ and let $P$ denote a principal $G$-bundle over $X$. Then
we consider \ti{connections} in $P$. For background on connections see \fixme{...}.
A connection in $P$ is locally written\footnote{By ``locally'' here I mean ``on a patch $U \subset X$ where we
have chosen a local trivialization of the bundle $P$.''}
\begin{equation}
  D = \de + A, \qquad A \in \Omega^1(\fg),
\end{equation}
and has a curvature $2$-form $F \in \Omega^2(\fg_P)$,\footnote{$\fg_P$ means the \ti{associated bundle} to $P$ using the
adjoint action of $G$ on $\fg$. It locally looks like $\fg$ but globally twisted
by the transition functions of $P$. Some people would call this bundle $\ad P$. It is trvial when $\fg$ is abelian,
so in that case we really have globally $F \in \Omega^2(\fg)$.} 
locally written\footnote{To spell out the 
notation here: suppose $A = A_\mu^a T_a \de x^\mu$, with $T_a$ a basis for $\fg$, and define the structure constants
$f_{ab}^c$ by $[T_a, T_b] = f_{ab}^c T_c$; then $A \wedge A = \half f_{ab}^c T_c A_\mu^a A_\nu^b \de x^\mu \wedge \de x^\nu$.
Some people prefer to write this term as $\half [A,A]$, which makes it more obviously sensible
for arbitrary Lie groups as opposed to matrix groups. It vanishes when $\fg$ is abelian, so then we just have
$F = \de A$.}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:curvature}
  F = \de A + A \wedge A \in \Omega^2(\fg).
\end{equation}

Now, since $F$ is a $2$-form and we are in $4$ dimensions,
we can decompose $F$ under $\star$ as
\begin{equation}
  F = F^+ + F^-.
\end{equation}
The \ti{anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equation} is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sdym}
  F^+ = 0.
\end{equation}
We view this as a condition on the connection $A$.
For $G$ abelian (e.g. for $G = \U(1)$) the equation \eqref{eq:sdym} is linear in $A$.
% It simply says
% \begin{equation}
%   \de A = \star \de A.
% \end{equation}
% \begin{exercise}
% ...
% \end{exercise}
For $G$ nonabelian (e.g. for $G = SU(2)$) this
equation is \ti{nonlinear} in $A$, because of the quadratic part in \eqref{eq:curvature}.

\begin{exercise} Write out \eqref{eq:sdym} in detail in components, in two cases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For $G = \U(1)$: in this case you should get a system of $3$ linear equations for $4$ functions $A_\mu$
  ($\mu \in \{1,2,3,4\}$).
  \item For $G = \SU(2)$: in this case you should get a system of $9$ coupled nonlinear equations for
  $12$ functions $A^a_\mu$ ($\mu \in \{1,2,3,4\}$, $a \in \{1,2,3\}$).
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

% From now on we specialize to the interesting case $G = SU(2)$.
We consider the \ti{instanton moduli space}
\begin{equation}
  \cM = \{ \text{connections on $P$ obeying \eqref{eq:sdym}} \} / \fG
\end{equation}
where $\fG$ is the infinite-dimensional group of \ti{gauge transformations} ie
sections of $\Aut(P)$, acting on connections by
\begin{equation}
  D \mapsto g D g^{-1}.
\end{equation}

\begin{exercise}
Verify that $\fG$ acts on the space of solutions of \eqref{eq:sdym}. Write out this action
explicitly in components, when $G = \U(1)$ or $G = \SU(2)$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Show that when $G = \U(1)$, $\cM \simeq \cH_{2}^{-}(X)$; in particular, in this case
$\cM$ is a vector space. \fixme{warning: needs Hodge theory}
\end{exercise}

When $G$ is nonabelian, the situation is much more difficult.
$\cM$ is not a vector space. Nevertheless it has some reasonable geometric
structure.
From now on let us specialize to the case $G = \SU(2)$.
In this case $P$ is classified by the integer \fixme{explain what's $p_1$}
\begin{equation}
  k = \int_X p_1(P).
\end{equation}
\begin{fact}
If $k>0$ and the metric $g$ on $X$ is generic, then $\cM$ is a finite-dimensional manifold.
\end{fact}
(For non-generic $g$, $\cM$ may develop singularities corresponding
to reducible solutions of \eqref{eq:sdym}.)


\subsection{Donaldson invariants}

Donaldson's idea was to extract information about $X$ from
the study of $\cM$. The direct nonlinear analogue of the Betti numbers is the
\ti{dimension} of $\cM$: it turns out to be (for $X$ connected)
\begin{equation}
  \dim \cM = 8k - 3 (1 - b_1(X) + b_2^+(X)).
\end{equation}
But because $\cM$ is nonlinear there is more to it than just its dimension.
Donaldson introduced an \ti{orientation} on $\cM$
and a family of canonically defined
closed differential forms $\tau_\alpha \in \Omega^*(\cM)$,
labeled by classes $\alpha \in H_*(X,\Z)$.
Then he defined new invariants $\IP{\cO_{\alpha_1} \cdots \cO_{\alpha_k}}$
by, schematically,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:donaldson-integral}
  \IP{\cO_{\alpha_1} \cdots \cO_{\alpha_k}} = \int_\cM \tau_{\alpha_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \tau_{\alpha_k},
\end{equation}
and proved that they are independent of the Riemannian metric
$g$ (under the technical
assumption $b_2^+(X) > 1$.)

These invariants proved very powerful: they could detect phenomena invisible to 
the standard differential-topology methods \fixme{explain something proved using them?} 
However, they were also very technically
difficult to control, particularly because $\cM$ is typically
\ti{noncompact}.


\subsection{QFT and Donaldson invariants}

In 1988, following some provocative suggestions of Atiyah,
Witten found a remarkable new way of thinking about
the Donaldson invariants \cite{Witten:1988ze}: he interpreted them
in terms of a certain quantum field theory (QFT),
\ti{topologically twisted $\N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory}.
Very roughly, Witten imagined $X$ to be the ``spacetime''
in some hypothetical universe, where the laws of physics are governed
by topologically twisted $\N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory,
and then imagined
making some ``experimental measurements'' in that universe --- captured
in QFT language by \ti{correlation functions}.

According to the rules of Lagrangian QFT\footnote{Lagrangian QFTs are an
important and widely studied class of QFTs, which feature prominently
(for good reason) in one's early QFT education. Nevertheless, not
all QFTs are of this sort; for QFTs which are not Lagrangian, one
needs other tools for computing the correlation functions. Many of the
most interesting mathematical and physical applications of QFT
involve non-Lagrangian QFTs.}
correlation functions are supposed to be integrals over an
infinite-dimensional space $\cC$, of the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:correlator}
 \IP{\cO_\alpha} = \int_\cC \de \mu \, \Phi_\alpha \e^{-S},
\end{equation}
where $S: \cC \to \R$ is the ``action'' of the theory,
$\de \mu$ is some measure of integration,
and $\Phi_\alpha: \cC \to \R$ are the ``classical observables.''
$\cC$ is sometimes called the ``space of fields''; in a general Lagrangian QFT, it is
something like the space of all\footnote{The meaning of ``all'' will
hopefully become clearer as we go on.} functions on $X$ (or maybe differential forms on $X$,
connections on bundles over $X$, sections of bundles over $X$, etc; different theories involve
different notions of fields.) 
% In the particular theory we are considering,
% $\cC$ and $S$ are given in \S\ref{sec:intro-action} below.

In general, correlation functions \eqref{eq:correlator}
are difficult to calculate.
In topologically twisted $\N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, 
however, there is a remarkable
\ti{localization} phenomenon which reduces the desired
integrals \eqref{eq:correlator} to the simpler
finite-dimensional integrals \eqref{eq:donaldson-integral} above.

% One of the aims of this course is to give some meaning to these
% phrases. It must suffice now to say: a quantum field theory is a
% rather complicated object, with much more structure than was
% at first apparent in Donaldson theory, and correlation functions
% are one of the basic objects of study in quantum field theory.

Impressive as this discovery was, it did not lead to any immediate
breakthroughs in Donaldson theory as far as I know:
the formulas one could directly
derive from the QFT perspective were just the \ti{same} formulas
already written down by Donaldson.


\subsection{The action} \label{sec:intro-action}

For aficionados, here is
the standard way that a physicist would define
$\N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, in Euclidean signature,
on the spacetime $X = \R^4$.

First, we need to fix a compact Lie group $G$ and two couplings: $g \in \R_+$ and
$\vartheta \in \R / 2 \pi \Z$. The QFT we want to describe depends on these
data.

We fix also an auxiliary $2$-dimensional complex vector space $R$, carrying
Hermitian structure $\delta: R \otimes \overline R \to \C$
and volume form $\eps \in \wedge^2(R)$. (Concretely, you may as well pick
$R = \C^2$ with its standard Hermitian structure and volume form. The main reason for
calling it $R$ now is that later we will replace it by a rank $2$ Hermitian
vector bundle over $X$.)

Then we let $\cC$ be the space of fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(P,\nabla)$ a principal $G$-bundle with connection (with curvature $F$),
\item $\phi \in \Gamma(\fg_{\C,P})$,
\item $\lambda^\pm \in \Pi \Gamma(S^\pm \otimes \fg_{\C,P} \otimes R)$,
\item $D \in \Gamma(\fg_{\C,P} \otimes \Sym^2 R)$,
\end{itemize}
where $S^\pm$ are the spin representations of $\Spin(4)$. The symbol $\Pi$ here means ``parity change''
which means $\lambda^\pm$ are \ti{Grassmann-odd} fields: we will explain this (or at least get used to it)
later.

The \ti{action} is:
\begin{multline} \label{eq:n=2sym-action}
 S = \frac{1}{g^2} \int_X \Tr\left( - \frac14 F \wedge \star F + \nabla_\mu \bar\phi \nabla^\mu \phi - \I \delta^{vw} \IP{\lambda_v^-, \slashed\nabla \lambda_w^+} + \frac14 \delta^{vv'} \delta^{ww'} D_{vw} D_{v'w'} - \half [\phi, \bar\phi]^2 \right. \\ \left. - \I \sqrt{2} \eps^{vw} \IP{\lambda_v^-, [\bar\phi, \lambda_w^-]} + \I \sqrt{2} \eps^{vw} \IP{\lambda_v^+, [\phi,\lambda_w^+]} \right) \\ + \frac{\I \vartheta}{4\pi^2} \int_X \Tr (F \wedge F).
\end{multline}

As described here, the theory only makes sense on $X = \R^4$.
Later we will describe Witten's modification of the
theory (topological twisting)
which we will use when we put it on a general Riemannian $4$-manifold $X$.

\subsection{Effective field theory: an analogy}

The real breakthrough came with the work of Seiberg and Witten
seven years later, in 1995 \cite{Seiberg:1994rs}.
In this work Seiberg and Witten answered a fundamental
question about $\cN=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory:
\ti{how does the theory behave at low energies?}

To understand how important this question is, let us make a quick
analogy. Suppose that we want to study a pond full of water and how
it will respond to, say, a gentle breeze, or a small toy boat.
One approach to this problem which we could imagine would be to say
to ourselves: well, the pond is made of about $10^{30}$ protons,
neutrons and electrons; let's write down equations governing those objects,
put them on the biggest supercomputer we can find, make a model for the
perturbation we want to study, and then have the computer solve the
equations and tell us what will happen. This (if it could be done)
would be in some sense the most \ti{direct} method.
Of course it is also completely hopeless.

In practice, we know that the relevant physical laws
governing a pond full of water are the Navier-Stokes equations. These
describe the dynamics of new ``effective''
variables (velocity, pressure, density, viscosity), whose relation
to the underlying $10^{30}$ particles would be complicated
to describe directly. Nevertheless Navier-Stokes is really the
description we want, for our practical purpose of studying boats
interacting with a pond. (It is probably \ti{not} the
relevant description if we want to know what will happen if we shoot the
pond with a high-intensity laser!)

The really hard and important problem is to go from the high-energy
description (elementary particles) to the low-energy description
(Navier-Stokes equations). Once this problem has been solved once,
we can then use the low-energy description to answer the questions
we care about.


\subsection{Seiberg-Witten equations}

Seiberg and Witten in \cite{Seiberg:1994rs}
solved the analogous problem for $\cN=2$
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Beginning with the action
\eqref{eq:n=2sym-action} (high-energy description) for $G = \SU(2)$,
they completely determined the low-energy description.
It turned out that this description is also in terms of gauge theory,
but this time gauge theory for the group $G' = \U(1)$ (coupled to matter):
the nonabelian group $\SU(2)$, with all its attendant
nonlinearities, is gone!

Then one can try to compute the results of experiments, now using this
effective low-energy description.
As before, the answer turns out to localize on some simple equations;
but now instead of \eqref{eq:sdym} the equations are
the \ti{Seiberg-Witten equations}\footnote{Some authors, including Witten in \cite{Witten:1994cg},
call \eqref{eq:sw} the \ti{monopole equations}. I think it is a good idea to avoid this name in order
not to confuse \eqref{eq:sw} with the \ti{Bogomolny equations} whose solutions are
monopoles: the relation between the field $\psi$ and the monopoles described by
Bogomolny equations is rather subtle. We will explore it later in the course.}
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:sw}
\begin{align}
  F^+ &= q(\psi, \bar\psi), \\
  \slashed{D} \psi &= 0,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where the fields are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $D$ is a connection in a $\U(1)$-bundle $E$
(more precisely $E$ is the determinant line of a $\Spin^c$-structure on $X$),
\item $\psi$ is a section of $S^+$, with $S^+$ the spinor bundle
attached to the $\Spin^c$-structure,
\end{itemize}
and $q$ is a certain
quadratic map $S^+ \otimes S^+ \to \wedge^2_+(T^* X)$.

In our analogy to the physics of a pond,
\eqref{eq:sw} is the moral analogue
of the Navier-Stokes equations.
What all this suggests is that \eqref{eq:sw} should be
just as powerful in $4$-manifold topology as was
\eqref{eq:sdym}, but in some sense easier to work with,
since in passing to \eqref{eq:sw} we have gotten rid
of some irrelevant complexity. This point of view was
advocated by Witten in the paper \cite{Witten:1994cg}
and it turned out to be correct.
This was the
beginning of a revolution in $4$-manifold topology which continues
to the present day.

One preliminary indication that the effective (Seiberg-Witten) description may be more convenient
than the high-energy (Donaldson) description is:
\begin{fact}
If the metric $g$ on $X$ is generic, then the moduli space
\begin{equation}
  \widetilde\cM = \{ \text{pairs $(D,\psi)$ obeying \eqref{eq:sw}} \} / \fG'
\end{equation}
is smooth and compact.
\end{fact}
This is very different from the space $\cM$ which is definitely \ti{not} compact for $k > 0$.


\subsection{Our goals}

In this course we are going to explore various geometric applications of quantum
field theory, emphasizing the two really nontrivial ingredients which have appeared
above:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ti{Localization}: the mechanism by which the formal
integrals over infinite-dimensional spaces which appear in quantum field theory
get related to finite-dimensional integrals which can be defined and computed.
One derives (in the physicist's sense) nontrivial facts about the finite-dimensional integrals,
using the infinite-dimensional integrals (i.e. the QFT) at some intermediate
stages.
\item \ti{Effective field theory}: the reduction from a complicated ``high-energy'' description
to a simple ``low-energy'' description of a physical system (say, a QFT).
\end{itemize}
Very roughly speaking, QFTs get more complicated as the dimension of spacetime increases.
Dimension $0$ and $1$ are relatively tractable --- even mathematically rigorous,
with some effort. In dimension $2$ there are still many rigorous things that can be said,
but already we begin facing difficulties, and these become more serious in dimensions $3$ and $4$.

I expect that we will study dimension $0$, dimension $1$, maybe a short stop in dimension $2$,
then jump to dimension $4$, in order that we can say something about the original motivation
of the Donaldson / Seiberg-Witten relation.

\section{Background}

Here I collect a little background material for convenience; I will probably
not lecture on this material.

\subsection{Spinors}

Good references for this are \cite{MR1031992,MR1367507}.

\begin{defn}[Free graded tensor algebra] Fix a real vector space $V$. The
\ti{free graded tensor algebra} $T(V)$ is
\begin{equation}
  T(V) = \bigoplus_{n=0}^\infty V^{\otimes n}
\end{equation}
equipped with the concatenation product
\begin{equation}
  (v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n) (w_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes w_m) = v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n \otimes w_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes w_m
\end{equation}
and the obvious $\Z$-grading.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Clifford algebra] Fix a real vector space $V$ with a
quadratic form $\IP{\cdot,\cdot}$. The \ti{Clifford algebra} $\Cliff(V)$ is the quotient
of $T(V)$ by the two-sided ideal generated by the relation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:clifford-relation}
  v \otimes v = -\IP{v,v}, \qquad v \in V.
\end{equation}
\end{defn}
More informally we could say $\Cliff(V)$ is the free algebra on $V$
subject to the single relation \eqref{eq:clifford-relation}.
This relation violates the $\Z$-grading but preserves a residual $\Z/2\Z$.
Thus $\Cliff(V)$ is a $\Z/2\Z$-graded algebra:
\begin{equation}
  \Cliff(V) = \Cliff^+(V) \oplus \Cliff^-(V).
\end{equation}

% In \eqref{eq:clifford-relation} we introduced a notation which we will use
% many times in the rest of the course: in graded algebras we have the
% graded commutator, defined on homogeneous elements by the formula
% \begin{equation}
%   [a, b] = ab - (-1)^{\deg a} (-1)^{\deg b} ba.
% \end{equation}

If $\IP{\cdot,\cdot}$ is the zero quadratic form then $\Cliff(V)$
becomes the exterior algebra $\wedge^*(V)$; more generally $\Cliff(V)$ is
a \ti{deformation} of $\wedge^*(V)$.

\begin{exercise} Show that $\dim_\R \Cliff(V) = 2^{\dim V}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{defn}[Pin group] $\Pin(V)$ is the group of all elements
\begin{equation}
 v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n \in \Cliff(V)
\end{equation}
where all $v_i$ have $\norm{v_i}^2 = \pm 1$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Spin group] $\Spin(V) = \Pin(V) \cap \Cliff^+(V)$.
\end{defn}

As a convenient notation we let $\Cliff(n)$ mean the Clifford algebra on the
vector space $\R^n$ with its standard positive definite quadratic form,
and similarly $\Spin(n)$, $\Pin(n)$ etc.

\begin{exercise} Show that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Cliff(1) \simeq \C$, $\Cliff^+(1) \simeq \R$, $\Spin(1) \simeq \Z / 2\Z$.
\item $\Cliff(2) \simeq \bbH$, $\Cliff^+(2) \simeq \C$, $\Spin(2) \simeq \U(1)$.
\item $\Cliff(3) \simeq \bbH \oplus \bbH$, $\Cliff^+(3) \simeq \bbH$, $\Spin(3) \simeq \SU(2)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{prop}[Spin group double-covers $SO$ group] There is a canonical
double-covering map
\begin{equation}
  \Spin(V) \to \SO(V).
\end{equation}
\end{prop}

When $n > 2$, $\Spin(n)$ is simply connected, so this map identifies
$\Spin(n)$ as the universal covering of $\SO(n)$.

\subsection{Hodge theory}

\begin{defn}[Formal adjoint of $\de$]
If $X$ is a Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$,
the formal adjoint of $\de$
is the operator
\begin{equation}
  \de^*: \Omega^{k}(X) \to \Omega^{k-1}(X)
\end{equation}
given by
\begin{equation}
  \de^* = (-1)^{n(k+1)+1} \star \de \star.
\end{equation}
\end{defn}

If $X$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, we have
the $L^2$ pairing on $\Omega^*(X)$ given by
\begin{equation}
  \IP{\alpha,\beta} = \int_X \IP{\alpha(x),\beta(x)} \, \de vol_X = \int_X \alpha \wedge \star \beta.
\end{equation}

\begin{lem}[Formal adjoint is actual adjoint on compact manifold]
If $X$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, $\de^*$ is the actual adjoint
with respect to the $L^2$ pairing, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \IP{\de^* \alpha,\beta} = \IP{\alpha,\de \beta}.
\end{equation}
\end{lem}

\begin{defn}[Laplace operator on Riemannian manifold]
If $X$ is a Riemannian manifold, we define the form Laplacian
\begin{equation}
  \Delta: \Omega^k(X) \to \Omega^k(X)
\end{equation}
by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:form-laplacian}
  \Delta = \de \de^* + \de^* \de.
\end{equation}
\end{defn}

\section{QFT in \texorpdfstring{$0$}{0} dimensions}

\subsection{The partition function and expectation values}

As we have explained above, Lagrangian QFT on a spacetime $X$ generally involves performing integrals
over some space $\cC$ of (perhaps generalized) functions on $X$. Thus $\cC$ is almost 
always infinite-dimensional,
but there is one key exception: the case where $X$ is $0$-dimensional. Let's explore that case.
We take $X$ to be just a point,
and $\cC$ to be the space of real-valued functions on a point, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \cC = \R.
\end{equation}
Then, let's define the action
\begin{equation}
  S: \cC \to \R
\end{equation}
by
\begin{equation}
  S(x) = \frac{m}{2} x^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4!} x^4, \qquad \re(\lambda) \ge 0, \ m > 0.
\end{equation}
Now we can define the \ti{partition function},
\begin{equation} \label{eq:0d-partition-fn}
  Z = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \de x \, \e^{-S(x)}.
\end{equation}
More generally, let's define an \ti{observable} to be any polynomial function $f: \cC \to \R$, and
then define its \ti{(unnormalized) expectation value}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:0d-expectation-values}
  \IP{f} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \de x \, f(x) \e^{-S(x)}.
\end{equation}
Thus, we have
\begin{equation}
  Z = \IP{1}.
\end{equation}
Both \eqref{eq:0d-partition-fn} and \eqref{eq:0d-expectation-values} are functions of
$\lambda$ and $m$.

\subsection{The perturbation series}

Now, how do we \ti{compute} these functions? Let's start with $Z$, given by \eqref{eq:0d-partition-fn}.
At $\lambda = 0$, the integral \eqref{eq:0d-partition-fn}
is easy to do:
\begin{equation}
  Z_0 = Z(\lambda = 0) = \sqrt\frac{2\pi}{m}.
\end{equation}
For other $\lambda$, what to do? Computing for arbitrary $\lambda$ looks hard, but since $\lambda = 0$ was
easy, let's try to get the expansion around $\lambda = 0$. 
We begin by expanding the exponential under the integral sign:
\begin{equation}
  Z(\lambda) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left( \frac{-\lambda}{4!} \right)^n \frac{x^{4n}}{n!} \e^{-\frac{m}{2} x^2}
\end{equation}
Next we make a dubious step: we exchange the orders of summation and integration.
\begin{equation}
  Z(\lambda) \, \text{''=''} \, \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left( \frac{-\lambda}{4!} \right)^n \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x^{4n}}{n!} \e^{-\frac{m}{2} x^2}
\end{equation}
The integrals can then be done term by term, yielding
\begin{equation} \label{eq:0d-perturbation-series}
  Z(\lambda) \, \text{''=''} \sqrt\frac{2\pi}{m} \left(1 - \frac18 \tlambda + \frac{35}{384} \tlambda^2 + \cdots + (1390.1 \dots) \tlambda^{10} + \cdots \right), \qquad \tlambda = \frac{\lambda}{m^2}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Meaning of the perturbation series}

Looking at the coefficients, the convergence of \eqref{eq:0d-perturbation-series} looks extremely 
unlikely. Indeed, this series diverges for all $\lambda \neq 0$, \ti{despite} the fact that the function
$Z(\lambda)$, defined by the integral \eqref{eq:0d-partition-fn}, 
really does exist whenever $\re(\lambda) \ge 0$.

One route to \ti{showing} that the series diverges is:
\begin{exercise}
Show that $Z(\lambda)$ admits analytic continuation to $\C \setminus \{ 0 \}$
and this continuation has an essential singularity at $\lambda = 0$. (Hint: use the 
fact that $Z(\lambda)$ obeys an ODE in $\lambda$.) Thus conclude that $Z(\lambda)$ cannot have
a convergent Taylor expansion around $\lambda = 0$.
\end{exercise}

Nevertheless, the series \eqref{eq:0d-perturbation-series} is still useful!
